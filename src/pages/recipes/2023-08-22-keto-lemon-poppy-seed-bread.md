## **Ingredients**

* 2 cups almond flour
* 1/4 cup coconut flour (optional)
* 1/2 cup erythritol (or your preferred keto-friendly sweetener)
* 1 tablespoon baking powder 
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup poppy seeds
* Zest of 2 lemons
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 3 large eggs
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the icing 

* 1/4 cup powdered erythritol (or powdered keto-friendly sweetener of your choice)
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest

## **Steps**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, coconut flour, erythritol, baking powder, and salt.

3. Stir in the poppy seeds and lemon zest, making sure they're evenly distributed throughout the dry mixture.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, lemon juice, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.

5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a smooth batter forms.

6. Transfer the batter to the greased loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

8. While the loaf bakes make the icing. 

9. Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.

10. Gently run a knife along the edges of the pan to loosen the bread, then carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

11. Slice and serve your Keto Lemon Poppy Seed Bread, enjoying the zingy flavors and moist texture while staying true to your keto lifestyle.
