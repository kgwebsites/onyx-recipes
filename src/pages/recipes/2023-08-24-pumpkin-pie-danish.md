## **Ingredients**

- 1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed
- 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 oz cream cheese, softened
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
- 3 tablespoon sliced almonds 

## **Steps**

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a rubber baking sheet.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.

3. Roll out the puff pastry sheet on the prepared baking sheet. Cut it into equal-sized squares, you should get 6 squares.

4. In another bowl, whip the softened cream cheese until smooth.

5. Place a dollop of cream cheese in the center of each puff pastry square, leaving a border around the edges.

6. Spoon a tablespoon of the pumpkin mixture on top of the cream cheese and “mix” with a toothpick.

7. Brush the tops of the pastries with the beaten egg wash for a golden finish.

8. Sprinkle sliced alminds on top.

9. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until the pastries are puffed up and golden brown.

10. Once baked, remove the pastries from the oven and allow them to cool on a wire rack.

11. Serve your Pumpkin Pie Danishes with icing or whipped cream and enjoy the delicious blend of pumpkin and cream cheese flavors in every bite!
