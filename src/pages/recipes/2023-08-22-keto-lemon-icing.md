## **Ingredients**

* 1/4 cup powdered erythritol (or powdered keto-friendly sweetener of your choice)

  \*A coffee grinder works well to make the powdered sugar. 
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest

## **Steps**

1. In a small bowl, combine the powdered erythritol, lemon juice, and lemon zest.

2. Whisk the ingredients together until you achieve a smooth and slightly thick consistency. If the icing is too thick, you can add a few drops of water or additional lemon juice to reach your desired consistency.

3. Allow the icing to set for a few minutes before using.
